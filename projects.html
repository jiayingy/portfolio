          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>We observed that professors tend to prepare documents in different versions (PowerPoint, PDF etc.) for lecture purposes. Students would usually receive the documents in PDF format. However, as students, we often find that the PDF format are restrictive as animations are removed and annotating and editing on the file is not flexible.</p>

          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>We want to provide a flexible and extensible document viewing and editing platform to be used during lectures and out of class revisions for both lecturers and students. Lecturers will be able to convert to different file formats easily and students will be able to have full editing capabilities. Users will use markdown language to create the documents.</p>

          <h3>My role</h3>
          <p>
            1. User Study <br>
            In order to identify the features needed in our application, we decided to interview lecturers to understand their needs and difficulties. We crafted the questions and conducted interviews with lecturers who fit into our target users. 
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Defining User Needs <br>
            From the interviews, we defined some of our user needs: <br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Users will be able to convert their documents to other versions while maintaining only one copy</li>
            <li>Users will be able to make use of rich text to edit the documents</li>
            <li>Users will be able to type out mathematical formulas</li>
          </ul>
          <p>3. Lo-fidelity Prototyping</p>
          <img src="" alt="">

          <p>4. Hi-fidelity Prototyping</p>
          After doing paper prototyping, I discussed with the group internally on the implementation of the features and proceeded to create hi-fidelity prototype with Sketch.
          <table class="prototype">
            <tr>
